BLOOD RELATIONS
=================

------------------------------------------------------------

BASIC IDEA
----------

Blood Relation questions test:

    • Family relationship understanding
    • Generation gap identification
    • Logical linking
    • Direction of relations


------------------------------------------------------------

1) BASIC FAMILY TERMS
---------------------

Father

    = Male parent


Mother

    = Female parent


Son

    = Male child


Daughter

    = Female child


Brother

    = Male sibling


Sister

    = Female sibling


------------------------------------------------------------

2) SECOND LEVEL RELATIONS
-------------------------

Grandfather

    = Father of father / mother


Grandmother

    = Mother of father / mother


Uncle

    = Brother of father / mother


Aunt

    = Sister of father / mother


Nephew

    = Son of brother / sister


Niece

    = Daughter of brother / sister


------------------------------------------------------------

3) IN-LAW RELATIONS
-------------------

Father-in-law

    = Father of spouse


Mother-in-law

    = Mother of spouse


Brother-in-law

    = Brother of spouse
      OR Husband of sister


Sister-in-law

    = Sister of spouse
      OR Wife of brother


------------------------------------------------------------

4) GENERATION LEVEL METHOD
--------------------------

Assign levels:

    Grandparents  →  +2

    Parents       →  +1

    Self          →   0

    Children      →  −1

    Grandchildren →  −2


Use this method to identify generation difference.


------------------------------------------------------------

5) SYMBOL BASED QUESTIONS
-------------------------

Common Symbols:

    +  →  Father

    −  →  Mother

    ×  →  Brother

    ÷  →  Sister


Always check symbol meaning given in question.


------------------------------------------------------------

6) POINTING TYPE QUESTIONS
--------------------------

Example type:

"Pointing to a woman, Ravi said,
She is the daughter of my grandfather's only son."


Steps:

    Step 1 → Identify grandfather's only son
             (That is Ravi's father)

    Step 2 → Daughter of Ravi's father

             = Ravi's sister


------------------------------------------------------------

7) CODED RELATION QUESTIONS
---------------------------

If A + B means A is father of B

Then in A + B − C

    A is father of B
    B is mother of C

So,

    A is maternal grandfather of C
