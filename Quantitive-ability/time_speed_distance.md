========================
TIME, SPEED AND DISTANCE
========================

------------------------------------------------------------

BASIC FORMULA
-------------

Distance

    = Speed × Time


Speed

    = Distance / Time


Time

    = Distance / Speed


------------------------------------------------------------

UNIT CONVERSION
---------------

1 km/hr

    = 5 / 18 m/sec


1 m/sec

    = 18 / 5 km/hr


------------------------------------------------------------

RELATIVE SPEED
--------------

1) Moving in Same Direction

Relative Speed

    = Difference of Speeds

    = | S1 − S2 |


2) Moving in Opposite Direction

Relative Speed

    = Sum of Speeds

    = S1 + S2


Time to meet or cross

    = Distance / Relative Speed


------------------------------------------------------------

AVERAGE SPEED
-------------

If equal distances are covered at speeds S1 and S2,

Average Speed

    = 2 × S1 × S2 / (S1 + S2)


If different distances,

Average Speed

    = Total Distance / Total Time


------------------------------------------------------------

TRAINS
------

1) Train crossing a pole

Time taken

    = Length of Train / Speed


2) Train crossing a platform

Time taken

    = (Length of Train + Length of Platform) / Speed


3) Two trains crossing each other

Time taken

    = (Sum of Lengths) / Relative Speed


------------------------------------------------------------

BOATS AND STREAMS
-----------------

Downstream Speed

    = (Speed of Boat + Speed of Stream)


Upstream Speed

    = (Speed of Boat − Speed of Stream)


Speed of Boat in Still Water

    = (Downstream + Upstream) / 2


Speed of Stream

    = (Downstream − Upstream) / 2


------------------------------------------------------------

INCREASE IN SPEED
-----------------

If speed increases by x%,

New Speed

    = Original Speed × (1 + x/100)


New Time

    = Original Time × 100 / (100 + x)


If speed decreases by x%,

New Time

    = Original Time × 100 / (100 − x)


------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT SHORT NOTES
---------------------

• Distance ∝ Speed (when time is constant)  
• Time ∝ 1 / Speed (when distance is constant)  
• Use relative speed in meeting and crossing problems  
• For equal distance problems, use harmonic mean formula
